# Magic Buttons Project

This is a simple webpage project one gets to style three buttons with different animations. Each button uses a unique style inspired by various button animations from CodePen.

## Project Overview

The project involves cloning a starter code from GitHub and adding custom CSS styles to buttons. Each button has a unique animation and styling inspired by examples from CodePen.

## Button Styles and Animations

### Button 1: A Gradient Expand

- **Class:** .btn-1
- **Inspiration:** CodePen button .btn-9
- **Animation Description:** When hovered over, the button's background changes from a gradient to transparent. Simultaneously, a scaled version of the gradient appears behind the button with a rotating effect, creating a dynamic, eye-catching transition. The box-shadow also changes, enhancing the 3D appearance of the button.

### Button 2: A Border Expand

- **Class:** .btn-2
- **Inspiration:** CodePen button .btn-8
- **Animation Description:** On hover, the button's background fades to transparent, and borders expand from the center to the edges of the button. This creates a frame-like effect. The text color also changes to match the border color, providing a cohesive visual effect.

### Button 3: A Radial Gradient Border

- **Class:** .btn-3
- **Inspiration:** CodePen button .btn-6
- **Animation Description:** When the button is hovered over, its background becomes transparent, and borders appear from the corners, growing to create a frame around the button. This transition is accompanied by a change in text color and the disappearance of the initial box-shadow, giving a clean and defined look.

## Design Choices

- **A Gradient Expand:** I chose it  for its visually appealing transformation and depth effect, enhancing user interaction.
- **A Border Expand:** I chose it because it provides a clean, minimalist design with a subtle but noticeable animation.
- **A Radial Gradient Border:** I chose it because of its sophisticated look, adding a modern touch with a smooth border animation.
- I also chose all of them because I like the colour purple and they were all  really cute.

## Challenges

- **Integration:** Incorporating animations from CodePen into a cohesive design without conflicting styles.
- **Cross-Browser Compatibility:** Ensuring that each animation works seamlessly across different browsers and devices.

## Features

- **Dynamic Animations:** Each button has a unique hover effect that enhances the user interface.
- **Responsive Design:** The buttons are styled to be responsive and visually appealing.
